<p>I’m currently doing master of Integrated Product Design in Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. And I did my bachelor in biomedical engineering in China. I’m passionate about incorporating design and technology to create miracles, as well as working in a team with a multi-cultural and interdisciplinary background. In the future, I intend to focus on human-centered design from ideation to launch, and improve people’s life through my works.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear from you!</p>
